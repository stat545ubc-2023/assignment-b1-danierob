# Project Description  
The purpose of this repository (assignment-b1-danierob) is to organize the files and code required to complete the introduction to making functions assignment for STAT 545. I will be primarily working with mini mock data sets and the penguins dataset from the palmerpenguins package to improve R and Git profeciency.

# Files Descrpition  
__README.md__ provides a brief descrption of the author, intent, and files in this repository.  

__Robinson_B1.Rmd__ is an R markdown file that was originally downloaded from the STAT 545 website to serve as the template for the B1 Assignment. This file is where all function creation will take place.
